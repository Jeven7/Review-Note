## 1. Introduction to GSE
### What is outsourcing
Relocation of software development activities from an “original” development site (the sending site) to an offshore site (the receiving site)

### Project context 
What | When | Where | How
-----| -----|-------|---
Type of work | Software life cycle | Destination | Type of collaboration
development project | from the beginning | Canada, Sweden, India | Follow-the-sun
three component development | from the beginning | US, UK, China | Component- based execution
software maintenance | At the end of the life cycle | Finland, Latvia | Transfer
remote testing | At the end of the life cycle | UK, India | Phase-based execution

### Organizational collaboration forms

### Critical factors that alleviate transfers
- Product
- People
- Process

### Negative impact of transfers
- Loss of knowledge within the product
- Temporary productivity decrease
- Initial reduction in scope of delivery
- Temporal decrease in quality
- Growing product entropy/complexity; technical degradation
- Lack of co-located expertise of all system's domains
- Prolongation of experts from original site for solving difficult problems
- Demands of more detailed requirements specification

### Key challenges for GSE
- Finding the right people
- Transferring the competence
    - Transferring the implicit knowledge
    - Finding effective training approaches
    - Limiting the scope of a transfer
    - Ensuring support after the product is transferred
    - Ensuring motivation
    - Providing sufficient documentation
- Maintaining on-going development
    - Balancing between transfer and operation
    - Ensuring non-interrupted secure transition
- Overcoming cultural differences
    - Overcoming attrition (resistance)
    - Ensuring effective communication

### Key challenges for the team
- Responsibility distribution
- Integration
- Efficiency
- Lack of flexibility
- Coordination and communication complexity
- Disparities (uneven) in work approaches

### Transfer models
- Phase-based model - most popular model
- Customization model
- Modularization model
- Distributed model
- Follow-the-sun model

### Integration problems

## project work
### The team & responsibilities
![Team Responsibilities](./Team%20Responsibilities.jpg)

### The Product Owner
- The focus is to control the backlog by working with the stakeholders identified
- Gather requirements for the backlog
- Solely controls the backlog
- Collaborate with the team and the scrum master to do release planning
- Guide and support the team
- Keeps himself/herself updated with project progress
- Are available to the team, give the team feedback
- Is one person, not a team

### The Development Team, the Scrum team
- Self-managed and self-organized
- Estimate backlog items, stories
- Turns items, stories into tasks to work on in the Sprints
- Commits to the sprint goals
- Keeps track of progress
- Responsible for Sprint demos
- The team should solve their internal problems by themselves
- The team should be small, 7 +- 2 persons
- Minimize communication interfaces
- Teams should be cross-functional, including different capabilities
- Open work environments are to be preferred

### The Scrum Master
- Ensuring that Scrum values, practices and rules are used
- Represents the management and the team to each other
- Guide and coach the team towards achieving the goals
- Should protect the team towards outside disturbances
- Support in keeping track of progress
- Organize retrospectives to help the team and the organization to learn how to be more effective
- Enforces immediate decisions needed

### Sprint
- A fixed period of time, usually 2 or 3 weeks but can be more
- Always use the same fixed period
- The development team should have full authority during the sprint
- The Sprint goal must be defined in advance
- The team can change the functionality of the Sprint, as long as it meets its sprint goal

### Daily Scrum meetings
- Where the team communicates
- Approximately 15 minutes, short meetings
- Stand-up meeting
- Focus on three things:
    1.	What has been done since the previous meeting?
    2.	What are we going to do?
    3.	What risks and problems exists?
- Removing obstacles
- Making necessary decisions

### The Sprint planning meeting
- Requirements and stories are presented in the product backlog
- The backlog can be re-prioritized based on the feedback
- Stories for the next sprint are selected
- Discussions on how, and estimations are done
- The Sprint Goal is defined
- Problems are discussed and impediments removed

## 3. Benefits of GSE
### GSE Pros
- Reduced development costs
- Leveraging time zone effectiveness
- Access to large skilled labor pool
- Closer proximity to market and customer
- Innovation and shared best practice
- Improved resource allocation

### GSE cons:
- Loss of knowledge within the product
- Temporary productivity decrease
- Initial reduction in scope of delivery
- Temporal decrease in quality
- Growing product entropy/complexity; technical degradation
- Lack of co-located expertise of all system's domains
- Prolongation of experts from original site for solving difficult problems
- Demands of more detailed requirements specification

### Achieving the benefits: Cost
#### What value we pay for
- release productivity
- years of experience
- quality level
- response times
- innovative capacity
- flexibility
- stability
- proximity to customers

### Achieving the benefits: Speed
#### Timezone effectiveness
- Suitable for independent work (e.g. separate modules, stand-alone tasks, testing, bug fixing)
- Major challenge - reliance on asynchronous communication when feedback is crucial
- Measured NOT through time zone difference, but through the amount of overlapping working hours

### Achieving the benefits: Skills
#### Access to large skilled labor pool
- Difficult to obtain:
  - Technical knowledge
  - Domain knowledge
  - Similar knowledge about software development
- Additional challenge: training people to take over an existing product to continue the on-going development
#### Closer proximity to market and customer
- Proximity to customers may increase the knowledge of the local market
- Creating new jobs can create good will with local customers, possibly resulting in more contracts

### Achieving the benefits: innovation and shared best practice
- Challenges:
  - Collaboration of team members who come from different national and organizational backgrounds
  - Collaboration between competitors
  - Collaboration between people who perceive that their counterparts are "stealing" their jobs
- Related topics: trust, fears
- This benefit, if expected, requires a different strategy
  - "Knowledge seekers" approach
  - Talent around the world is expensive

## 4. Project Management and Coordination in GSE
### What is a project?
A project is a temporary endeavor undertaken to create a unique product or service.
### Traditional Project management
- Project management is the application of knowledge, skills, tools, and techniques to project activities to meet the project requirements
- Five groups of activities can be identified:
    - Initiating
    - Planning
    - Executing
    - Monitoring and Controlling
    - Closing
### Major challenges - 3C
- Coordination
  - Diversity in ways of working
  - Lack of joint processes and tools
  - Poor coordination of tasks across locations
  - Lack of or poor understanding of requirements
- Communication
  - Trust
  - Language barriers
  - Culture barriers
  - Asychronouse work
  - Lack of cohesiveness
  - Knowledge and information sharing barriers
- Control
  - Lack of process transparency
  - Lack of progress visibility

### Coordination impediments
- Geographic distance
    - Lack of transparency of the tasks and activities
    - Computer-mediated processes
    - Lack of “next door” closeness
    - Limited ability of direct supervision and control
- Organizational differences
    - Difficult to convey vision and strategy
    - Inconsistency in work practices can impinge on effective coordination
    - Assumptions that distributed sites will behave in a certain way can be illusory
- Temporal distance
    - Limited overlap with colleagues
    - Delay of responses
    - People lose track of the overall work process
    - The lag in response time leaves with a feeling of “being behind” and “missing out”
    - In the long run make people frustrated
    - Time-shifting leads to working very late or early
### Coordinating mechanisms
- Standardization (The most effective way)
  - coordination by program, using architectural design and plans.
- Direct supervision
  - one person takes responsibility for the work of others by issuing instructions and monitoring their actions
- Mutual adjustment
  - based on the simple process of informal communication, achieved by a continuous exchange of information among participants

## 5. Cultural diversity, Motivation and Trust
### What is culture?
Culture is a set of shared experiences, understandings, and meanings among members of a group, an organization, a community, or a nation.
### Building blocks of culture
- values, including preferences people use to make work- related and communication related decisions in projects
- practices, including cultural norms for adopting specific project management styles and organization structures
### Cultural dimensions - Hofstede’s work
1. Power distance - how a society handles inequalities
2. Individualism/collectivism - behavior towards the group
3. Masculinity/femininity - behavior according to gender
4. Uncertainty avoidance - the need for structure
5. Long term orientation - value of long-standing traditions

### The effect of culture in software development organizations
- Organizational structures 
- Preferred management styles
- Preferred motivation tools 
- Decision making processes 
- Perceptions of authorities, time,... 
- Communication and interaction 
- Formalization

### An obvious no-match between agile method and cultural characteristics
#### Agile team requirements
- Autonomy
  - independence/freedom, innovativeness, authority
- Shared leadership
  - collective decision making, shared responsibilities
- Redundancy
  - backup behavior, collective ownership
- Team orientation
  - shared goals, active participation and dedication

### What is trust?
- Trust is the shared perception by the majority of team members that individuals in the team will perform particular actions important to its members and that the individuals will recognize and protect the rights and interests of all the team members engaged in their joint endeavor
- Trust is a fundamental factor that links global teams together

### Trust enables…
- Social communication
- Predictable communication patterns
- Feedback
- Positive leadership
- Enthusiasm
- Ability to cope with technical uncertainty
- Positive effect on cooperation and performance

### Lack of trust is caused by…
- Lack of shared mental model （认知模型）
- Poor socialization
- Missing face-to-face meetings
- No conflict handling
- Too little communication
- Unpredictability in communication
- Increased monitoring
- Poor socio-cultural fit
- Fears

### Cognition
- Virtual teams need to focus on the cognitive dimension of trust
  - competence
  - reliability
  - professionalism
### Socialization
- Socialization strategies can help develop trust
- Team members should travel to remote sites to engage in a team-building activities
- Face-to-face meetings are considered irreplaceable for both developing and repairing trust in virtual teams
- If there is no face-to-face communication in a virtual team, this tends to hinder effective communication

### Technology support
- Invest in groupware packages: effective means of communication
- Develop a 360º view (全方位） by establishing a team intranet

### Important for Scrum method 
- Commitment: we do what we say we will do
- Focus: we concentrate on and are answerable for doing the things that we have committed
- Openness: We strive to create an environment in which everybody feel safe to tell the truth
- Respect: We do not discriminate against others based on, but not limited to, gender, race, age, religion, disability, nationality, or sexual orientation.
- Courage: We would rather say, “no,” than make false promises

## 6. global teamwork and cooperation
### Why is teamwork important?
Because software development as any process that involves human interaction significantly depends on team performance.
### Team development
- Forming: the team gets together and gets to know each other. It clarifies roles, figures out the tasks and objectives
- Storming: conflicts break out over roles, objectives, and task allocations. Different leaders, official or otherwise, are pursuing different goals
- Norming: the team begins to form norms, roles, and protocols for working together. Some team cohesion may begin.
- Performing: the team begins to perform well, working together toward a common goal. Conflicts are handled constructively

### "big 5" of teamwork
1. Team Leadership
    - ability to direct and coordinate other team members’ activities, assess team performance, assign tasks, develop team knowledge and skills, motivate team members, plan and organize, and establish a positive atmosphere.
2. Mutual performance monitoring
    - ability to develop common understandings of the team environment and apply appropriate task strategies to accurately monitor teammate performance.
3. Backup behavior
    - ability to anticipate other team members’ needs through accurate knowledge about their responsibilities. Includes the ability to shift workload among members to achieve balance during high periods of workload or pressure.
4. Adaptability
    - ability to adjust strategies based on information gathered from the environment through the use of backup behavior and reallocation of intra-team resources.
5. Team orientation
    - Tendency to take others’ behavior into account during group interaction and belief in importance of team goal over individual members’ goals.
### Global Teams
- A global software team is a team whose members collaborate on a common software project while working across geographic, temporal, cultural, and relational boundaries to accomplish an interdependent task
- This is also a virtual team
### Distant communication
- Face-to-face meetings
- Tele-conferences / phone calls
- Video-conferences
- E-mails
